**First steps: Evaluating**

Before beginning the archival process, ask yourself fundamental questions about your goals and the repository’s significance.

Why Are You Archiving This Repository?

Understanding your motivation helps determine the appropriate preservation approach:

- Software history preservation: Contributing to the history of software development
- Personal backup: Ensuring your own work is safely stored
- Community preservation: Protecting software important to a specific community
- Emergency rescue: Saving at-risk code before it disappears
- Research purposes: Preserving software for academic story or reproducibility

- Ask yourself, why are *you* archiving a github repository?
  - How to evaluate if a repository is worth preserving
    - It’s significant in software history, technological development, or a specific community that you’re a part of
    - It’s in danger of being removed, outlawed, or otherwise made inaccessible
  - Software history or personal backup?
- Is it preserved already?
  - Check: Software Heritage
- Github Repository Evaluation Checklist
  - How complete and usable is the software? 
  - Are there fundamental issues that still have yet to be solved?
  - Are there other dependencies that would not get covered by the source code? (idk)
  - 
  - identify the code hosting places, from well known development platforms to niche archives
  - try to accommodate specifics of source code’s hosting environment
  - crawl development histories as captured by wide variety of version control systems (Git, Mercurial, Subversion, Darcs, Bazaar, CVS, & more)
  - version_history.csv contains:
    - director name, author name, author email, date original, curator name, curator email, release tag, commit message
  - Tasks could involve:
    - transcribing hand-written code, finding code from different hardware, interviews
