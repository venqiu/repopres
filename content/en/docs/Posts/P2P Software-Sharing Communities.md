**P2P Software-Sharing Communities**

- If you believe the software you are attempting to preserve may not be welcome in on SWH, and you hope for more distribution and shared responsibility for preserving it beyond your own hard drive(s), then seeding it in P2P file-sharing communities may be the answer
- This is out of scope for this toolkit but if you are interested in joining then keep your eyes peeled on the subreddits and discords of communities such as [this] or [that] for opportunities to be invited into the community
