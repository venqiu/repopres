**Decision Guide: Preservation Resources and Destinations:**

Depending on who you are and the skills you have, you may decide to preserve source code locally, through an organization like Software Heritage, or through your institution’s digital preservation system. There are pros and cons to each of these options:

**Local route**

- Pros: 
  - You only need to rely on yourself
  - You can make your own preservation decisions decide your own best practices (e.g. the types of metadata, ancillary materials, and other information to provide about each repo)
  - Privacy: you have full control over the access of this software
- Cons: 
  - You are not bound to terms and services of any organization, or online platform, or copyright law 
  - You have to pay for your own storage space

**Software Heritage**

- Pros: 
  - Institutionally backed, sustained project with funding
  - Rigorous archiving, centralized
  - Contextualized with other softwares (good for software history)
- Cons:
  - Subject to European copyright law
  - Cannot change the metadata fields
  - All decisions are subject to approval

**Institutional Route**

- Pros:
  - Institutional resources and stability
  - Digital preservationists and colleagues
- Cons:
  - Need to work with the DAMS used by your institution already, which may not be suitable for archiving software
